Step-by-Step: Using py-spy in AKS
ðŸ§© Prerequisites

    Your FastAPI app must be running in a Linux-based container.

    The container must include proc filesystem access (default for most containers).

    You need the ability to exec into the pod/container.

âœ… Step 1: Install py-spy into the Container
Option A: Inject at Build Time (Recommended for Staging)

In your Dockerfile, add:

RUN curl -sSL https://github.com/benfred/py-spy/releases/latest/download/py-spy-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/py-spy && \
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/py-spy

Option B: Temporary Install in Running Pod (for Prod Debugging)

kubectl exec -it <your-pod-name> -- /bin/sh

# Inside container:
wget https://github.com/benfred/py-spy/releases/latest/download/py-spy-linux-x86_64 -O /usr/local/bin/py-spy
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/py-spy

âœ… Step 2: Find the PID of the Python Process

ps aux | grep python

Example output:

root         1  0.0  0.1  ... uvicorn app.main:app

Usually the main Python process will be PID 1 inside the container.
âœ… Step 3: Start Profiling (Live or Flamegraph)
ðŸ”¹ Option 1: Live CPU Usage View

py-spy top --pid 1

This gives you a real-time, top-like view showing which functions consume the most CPU.
ðŸ”¹ Option 2: Generate a Flamegraph

py-spy record -o /tmp/profile.svg --pid 1 --duration 60

    Captures 60 seconds of CPU profiling data

    Outputs an SVG flamegraph at /tmp/profile.svg

Then, copy it out of the container:

kubectl cp <pod-name>:/tmp/profile.svg ./profile.svg

Open it in your browser.
âœ… Step 4: Stop the Profiler

    py-spy record will exit automatically after the duration you specify.

    py-spy top can be stopped with Ctrl+C.

ðŸ“Š Analyze Results

    Flame graphs show the call stack and CPU time visually.

    Youâ€™ll be able to identify functions or loops that consume the most CPU.

    Can help detect inefficient loops, blocking I/O, or deep recursive calls.
