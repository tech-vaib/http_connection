Looking at your numbers:

DNS:     0.217451s   → 217 ms  (DNS resolution)
Connect: 0.218935s   → 219 ms  (TCP connection setup)
TLS:     0.418068s   → 418 ms  (TLS handshake completed)
TTFB:    0.511709s   → 512 ms  (time to first byte)
Total:   0.511738s   → 512 ms  (full download — very small payload)

Here’s what it tells us:
Observations

    DNS resolution (217 ms) is quite high.

        Normally DNS should be <20 ms for a well-optimized path.

        This suggests your AKS node (or your local test machine) is using a slow DNS resolver, or it’s querying an external resolver far away.

    TCP connection time (219 ms) is about the same as DNS time, meaning the server might be physically far from you (network latency).

    TLS handshake (418 ms) is also high. This includes the time for key exchange and certificate validation.

        If network latency is high, TLS will also be slow because it needs multiple round trips.

    TTFB (512 ms) isn’t much higher than TLS time, meaning the server responds almost instantly once the connection is ready — your backend is fast, the slowness is all network + DNS.

How to Improve
1. Fix DNS resolution

    In AKS, check which DNS your pods/nodes are using:

    cat /etc/resolv.conf

    Often it’s Azure-provided DNS (168.63.129.16), but you can speed this up by:

        Using Azure Private DNS Zones if the service is in your subscription.

        Using a faster public DNS (Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 or Google 8.8.8.8) if you’re hitting a public endpoint.

        Pre-resolving domain names (caching in your app or sidecar like dnsmasq).

2. Reduce network latency

    If your AKS cluster is in a different Azure region than the public endpoint, latency will be higher.

    Ideally, place your AKS cluster in the same region as the endpoint’s hosting location.

    Test latency directly with:

    ping <hostname>
    traceroute <hostname>

    to see where time is lost.

3. Speed up TLS handshake

    Enable HTTP Keep-Alive in your httpx.AsyncClient (you already are, since you’re reusing clients — but check max_keepalive_connections).

    If the endpoint supports HTTP/2, enable it (httpx does by default).

    If it’s your server, enable TLS session resumption.

4. Warm up DNS + TCP in your app

Since you have a ConnectionManager in your code, you can:

    Create the client once and reuse it (you are doing this).

    Optionally make a dummy request to the endpoint at startup so DNS/TLS is cached before load starts.
